        <h3>who i am</h3>
        My pet cat is called milo, he is a Siamese cat. My younger brother named
        our cat milo because he thought it would be funny to give our cat a
        human name. Most of my relatives also think that that is funny because
        their pet cats have names like ‘Fluffy.’ I wanted to name my cat
        Garfield, as the comic because I love reading Garfield comics, but now
        his name is milo.

        <h3>my hobbies</h3>
        milos favourite hobbies are sticking his paws and head under the running
        water and playing in it - then will sit there for 10 minutes drinking
        from the running water, he also loves chasing strings, and playing
        fetch. He has one ball in particular that he likes to play with and he
        will always put the ball in his mouth, find me and drops the ball at my
        feet. I'll throw the ball, he chases it and brings it back to me.

        <h3>learn more</h3>
        Cats have highly developed senses - they can detect higher frequencies
        of sound than dogs or humans, and have an excellent sense of smell -
        better than ours! They can see better than us in dark and dim light.
        Cats are expert hunters and hunt alone. In the wild, they'll spend 6-8
        hours a day hunting. They can hear the high-pitched frequencies used by
        small rodents and their whiskers (or 'vibrissae') are highly sensitive
        to vibrations, helping them to detect prey.
